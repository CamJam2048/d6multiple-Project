	<h2><a>Core Mechanics</a></h2>
		<h3><a>Warhammer 40k tabletop generally centers around two players taking 
		turns strategically battling one another in a tabletop environment. 
		This website will help with expediting the Shooting, Charge, and Fight phases. It is also possible to utilize the 
		dice roll system to roll for units advancing during the Movement phase 
		as well where one dice is rolled and that value is added to a unit's total 
		movement, IE. a die value of 3, will add 3 inches of movement.
		<br><br>
		An example of a players starts with the Command Phases, where the player
		whose turn it is will have options for giving orders to their units or 
		other special abilities for specific units. The player will then move into
		the Movement phase where they will move their models around the tabletop
		based off their unit's movement speed, IE. 6" or 12". Then the player will
		enter the shooting phase, there are many rules regarding eligble targets for
		shooting and it really comes down to what the players agree is a valid attack.
		This is the first phase where this website can really help with depending on
		how many attacks are being made. After all shooting is done, the player will 
		then select units to make charges to try and enter into melee range with enemy
		units. This phase relies on two dice being rolled for a maximum of 12 inches of
		movement. After all charges are completed the player will then select units that 
		are in engagement range (1 inch away) with enemy models. This phase works similarily
		to the shooting phase. After the fight phase, the player can then move models up to 
		3 inches either to further encircle enemy models, or towards an objective point. 
		The players turn is now finished and the opposing player begins their turn following
		these same phases.

	<h2><aa>Additional Examples</aa></h2>
		<h3><a>Warhammer 40k can be a very confusing game at first glance with a lot of rules
		and things going on. However, it is not super complicated. The best way to learn, is 
		to have fun and play the game! <br><br>When attacking, the attacking player will
		first roll to see if their attack hits. The value to determine a successful hit
		is found on the attacking unit's datacard and will either be BS(Ballistic Score) for 
		shooting, or WS(Weapon Score) for fighting. The BS or WS value for an attack is taken
		from the weapons that are being used for the attack. In addition to these values,
		weapons also have an AP(Armor Piercing) value which will make the attack more difficult
		to save from when the defending player is rolling.<br><br>The table below shows what dicve values are needed for
		a successful attack depending on the strength and toughness stats of units involved.
		A dice roll of 1 is always a failure, and a roll of 6 is always a success. This rule
		does not always apply to saves, but this exemption is dependant on the other player as
		making an imnpossible roll is sometimes exciting. The values for unit strength and toughness
		can be found on the specific unit's datacard. The strength value of the attacking unit is
		then compared to the toughness of the unit being attacked. </a></h3>
